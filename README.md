# Distributed Image Processing in Cloud Dataproc

The purpose of this project is to use a distributed computing platform and perform a task suited to the platform. For this project, I did a face detection task using GCP Dataproc. Essentially, after uploading images to a bucket, this enables face detection of those images and outputs an image where faces are outlined.
